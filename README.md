# nMix: Mixnet-based secure voting

nMix is an open source backend for a mixnet-based, cryptographically secure voting system, featuring strong privacy and verifiability properties. It is a reactive implementation of the core [univote](https://e-voting.bfh.ch/projects/univote/) crypto specification, with a few changes.

### Cryptographic scheme

The main elements of the cryptographic scheme are

* ElGamal homomorphic distributed cryptosystem[1][5]
* Verifiable re-encryption mixnet with Terelius-Wikstrom shuffles[2][3][6]
* Joint key-generation / decryption with zero knowledge correctness proofs[5]
* Tamper-resistant bulletin board hash-chain[7]
* RSA message signing and trustee authentication[8]

Together with suitable cryptographic mechanisms at the voting booth this produces an [end-to-end verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems) voting system. More details of the scheme can be found [here](http://davidruescas.com/?p=3651).

### Software architecture

nMix follows a minimal design, composed of

* An append-only bulletin board backed by Git
* A reactive, data-driven election protocol specified declaratively
* A minimal rule engine for boolean expression conditions
* [libmix](https://github.com/ruescasd/libmix) (including [unicrypt](https://github.com/bfh-evg/univote2)) library for multicore support

which allows for

* Fault tolerance through stateless and idempotent trustees
* Auditability and tamper resistance via Git's hashchain
* Simple network toplogy: centralized communication on a single ssh port
* Simple software deployment: Java8 (+ Git on the bulletin board server)

### Quickstart

The best place to start is to follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/nVotes/nMix/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md). You can
run an election demo on a single machine without having to do a real world distributed deployment.
